= Web Application Development with Python(Flask) Workshop 

In this workshop we will build a web application using Flask.
Flask is a *micro web framework* written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.


== Week 0: Python Environment Setup 

- Install Python
- Install VS Code
- Python Virtual Environmnet (pip,pipenv) * for mac use brew
- Git/Github 
- Download git from https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git


== Git Basics

[source,bash]
----
git --verison
git init #initialize git
git status # status of the project
git add <file-name> # Add a single file
git add . # add all files
git commit -m " Message " # commit git
git push # push to your repository's main branch
git push -u origin <branch-name>
git branch <branch-name>
----

== Week 1: Python Language Refresher
 - PEP8 Naming Conventions
 - *List*
 - Tuple 
 - Sets
 - *Dict*
 - Functions
 - Classes
 - Standard Libraries
 - Generators
 - Context Managers

=== PEP8 Naming Conventions
==== What is PEP 8?
- PEP: A Python Enhancement Proposal
- PEP 8: A set of style guidelines for Python
    - Widely used
    - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

==== Why follow PEP 8?
- Readable code
    - Mostly for yourself (and other developers)

- User-friendly code
    - Following naming conventions is a way to document your code
    - Mostly useful for users (which can be developers too)
===== regular_variables
Variable names should be lowercase, where necessary separating words by underscores
[source,python]
----
first_name = 'Jaamac'
----

===== CONSTANTS
In Python, all variables can be modified therefore, real constants don't exist But to indicate that a variable should be treated as if it were a _constant_, names should be uppercase, where necessary separating words by underscores
[source,python]
----
PI = 3.1415 # Constant variable
SERVER_NAME = 'server'
----
===== function_names()
Names of functions and class methods should be lowercase, where necessary separating words by underscores

[source,python]
----
def add_two_numbers(num1,num2):
    return num1+num2
----

===== ClassNames
Class names should capitalize the first letter of each word

[source,python]
----
class MyServer:

    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
----

===== conflicting_names_
If a name is already taken, suffix an underscore
[source,python]
----
list_ = [12,34,6]
----

==== The most important naming conventions

==== regular_variables
Variable names should be *lowercase*, where necessary separating words by underscores
